### Health analytics is the process of examining and interpreting data related to healthcare, in order to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the overall quality of healthcare services. It involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of health-related data, including patient medical records, electronic health records, claims data, and public health information.

### Health analytics can be used to answer a variety of questions, such as: what factors contribute to the development of a particular disease? Which treatments are most effective for certain conditions? How can we improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions? By analyzing data and using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, health analytics can help healthcare providers and policymakers make informed decisions and take proactive measures to improve public health.
